            <p>
                Dorian Gray was in seventh heaven as he looked at his own magnificent portrait painted by the well known artist Basil Hallward in his London studio. However as he continued to admire his own portrait with amazement he got lost in his thoughts. “How sad it is I shall grow old, horrible and dreadful,” he said to himself, “But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June. If it was only the other way round! If it was I, who was to be young always and the picture that was to grow old. For  that I would give everything. 
                Surprisingly his wish was granted by God.</p><p>
                From that day onwards gray always remained young and handsome while his portrait gradually showed signs of ageing. When he found out what was happening, he began to indulge in all kinds of immoral activities, thinking that nothing bad would ever happen to him. Lord Henry whom he had met and befriended at the studio always encouraged him to seek the pleasure of life as it were no tomorrow.</p><p> 
                Gray’s family and friends were horrified at the way he was leading his life. They tried to admonish him but to no avail.  His wrong approach to life led to the suicide of a young girl, whose brother wanted to avenge her death. However, Gray never lost his sleep as he had consciously stopped listening to his conscience.
                In the meantime, Gray was stunned to see a change in his portrait. The face in the portrait looked different from what  it looked before, there was a touch of cruelty in the face. It definitely showed signs of ageing. The portrait was beginning to reflect the picture of his callous and unrepentant soul. Thereafter, very time Gray looked at the portrait he shrieked with fear.</p><p>
                Artist Hallward who heard about Gray’s wayward and sinful ways felt sorry for him as he had great admiration for him as a model. When Hallward was preparing to move from London to Paris for six months he decided to pay a visit to Gray. While meeting with him the artist was shocked to see the moral collapse of Gray. But Gray was not willing to admit his moral decay. He tried to cover it up with  lame excuses.</p><p>
                While Gray continued to defend himself , Hallward said,’ I wonder if I know you? </p><p>Before I could answer,  I have to see your soul.”</p><p>
                “To see my soul!” Gray mutterd as he shuddered.</p><p>
                “Yes to see your soul. But only God can do that.” said Hallward.</p><p>
                “But only God can do that.” Gray laughed.</p><p>
                But it was mocking laughter. “You shall see it for yourself tonight,” Gray said. </p><p>“Come with me. You shall see the thing you fancy only God can see.”</p><p>
                Gray took him upstairs where the portrait was kept. “So you think it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw the curtain back, and you will see mine.”</p><p>
                Hallward didn’t know what was happening. “You are mad, Dorian,” he muttered refusing to draw the curtain.</p><p>
                Immediately, Dorian drew the curtain, uncovering the portrait which looked ghastly and loathsome. Hallward couldn’t believe it was the same portrait he had painted, however his signature at the bottom revealed that it was his painting.</p><p>
                While Hallward stood there dumbstruck. Dorian explained how his wish was granted by God to remain young and healthy always, while portrait aged in his place.</p><p>
                “My God if it is true.” Hallward exclaimed, “and this is what  you have done to your life.”</p><p>
                Gray agreed it was true but refused to improve his life as begged by Hallward, saying it was too late to repent. Their encounter that night led to Gray murdering Hallward.</p><p>
                Having realized that he had committed a grievous crime, he ran away from his home. He wandered to a far place. One day he came across an old enemy who wanted to kill him to avenge his sister’s death. Dorian ran from there and lived in fear of losing his life until the enemy got killed in an accident.</p><p>
                Now Dorian decided to get rid of immoral activities. Dorian wondered if his new-found goodness had reverted the corruption in the picture, but when he looked he saw only an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understood that his true motives for the self-sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences, along with the desire to restore beauty of the picture.</p><p>
                Deciding that only full confession will absolve him of wrongdoing, Dorian decided to destroy the last vestige of his conscience, and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimes—the picture. In a rage, he took the knife with which he murdered Basil Hallward, and stabbed the picture. The servants of the house became alarmed on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, passers-by who also heard the cry called the police. On entering the locked room, the servants found an unknown old man, stabbed in the heart, his face and figure withered and decrepit. The servants identified the disfigured corpse by the rings on its fingers which belonged to their master; beside him was the picture of Dorian Gray, restored to its original beauty.</p><p>
                 In this novel Lord Henry plays an important role. He is the one who drives Dorian into the evil world. Also the epigrams of Lord Henry shoot arrows of gentle satire on different elements of society.</p><p>
                Oscar Wilde has created an amusing tale that does not end very happily but ends beautifully with our easy-going Lord Henry still chirping.

            <h2>Moral:</h2>
            <p>
                As Hallward said to Dorian, in the novel, only God really knows how our soul really looks like. However if we closely examine our self we may get a good idea of how it is. Our thoughts, words, and actions will always have an impact on our soul. In fact they will be reflected in our soul. If that is the case we can get a picture of our soul by examining our thoughts, words and actions.
                If we don’t know how our soul looks like it is because we don’t examine ourselves. We should find some time in our lives to introspect ourselves. A few minute of meditation or a silent prayer before bed may help with that. In this book Dorian Gray had an amazing opportunity to realize that his soul was decaying because of his evil deeds, but he failed to improve them.
